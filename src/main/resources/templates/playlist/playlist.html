                And, thank you for choosing to join this design journey towards an educational tool. First up, is a basic
                version of the Playlist feature. When you click the button below you will be able to create a
                playlist that can consist of different tasks found in the ACC Skill Circuit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Determine the amount of time you want to be busy studying and fill the playlist with tasks
                <i>estimated</i> to fit that timeframe. During studying the playlist will help you keep track of time
                passed and adjust the playlist accordingly. </br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We cannot guarantee this feature is bug-free, so please bear with us. Any feedback you have is of course
                highly appreciated, but as this is part of a research we must collect that anonymously. A way to provide
                anonymous feedback will be added soon&trade;
