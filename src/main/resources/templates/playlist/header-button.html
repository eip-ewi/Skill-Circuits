                <h1>Co-design a new feature: Playlist</h1>
                <p class="tldr">TL;DR: A playlist can be seen as an automatically generated to-do list that takes
                    into account the time needed to complete tasks. During this quarter the feature will be further
                    developed based on theory and your feedback! We of course need your permission to collect your data
                    and feedback.</p>
                <h2>What is this Playlist?</h2>
                <p>
                    As part of a Master's thesis a new feature for Skill Circuit will be tested.
                    Called <em>Playlist</em>, this feature creates a to-do list for you based on the activities in your
                    circuit and the time you have available to study. It will then <i>play</i> through these activities
                    to help structure your study session. <br>
                    Throughout this academic quarter different functionalities of <em>Playlist</em> will be tested,
                    starting with a basic implementation in week 3.2. <br>
                    The different iterations of <em>Playlist</em> allow us to try different ways of implementing this
                    feature while collecting your usage data and feedback on its usefulness. Additionally, we would love
                    to involve you in its design process if you wish to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>Opt-in required for research</h2>
                <p>
                    If you wish to use and test this feature, you are required to give permission for your usage data to
                    be collected and used in research. The research study is titled <i>“Skill Circuit and
                    Playlists”</i> and is being done as part of a master's thesis. Data will be collected throughout Q3
                    of academic year 2023/2024 at the TU Delft. Examples of such data are how long you have been logged
                    in or which buttons you have clicked.<br>
                    Throughout your usage of this feature you will also be asked to give feedback on the tool. This is
                    not mandatory but highly appreciated. The purpose of this research study is to gain insights and
                    feedback on both the initial design of a learning tool and its design process. The data will be
                    used for adjusting the tool’s design and design process, and further guide the master’s thesis.
                    De-identified or aggregated data may be published in an openly available repository, in accordance
                    with the TU Delft Research Data policy.<br>
                    <strong>Without giving your permission to collect usage data you cannot use and test this new
                        feature</strong>. <br><br>
                    To the best of our ability your data collected in this study
                    will remain confidential. We will minimalize any risks by only collecting the following personally
                    identifiable research data (PIRD): the course you are using the <em>Playlist</em> feature in.
                    Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time.
                    You are free to omit any feedback prompts given by the tool and leave the study prematurely.
                    If you decide to leave the study prematurely, your permission will be asked to still use your data
                    collected up until that point. If you do not consent, no data of yours will be used. You will also
                    no longer have access to the <em>Playlist</em> feature. <br>

                    <span>I agree that my anonymized usage data of Skill Circuit and the Playlist feature will be
                                collected for the research study <i>“Skill Circuit and Playlists”</i>. This data and any
                                feedback I decide to give during the study will be used to improve the feature's design and
                                design process during Q3. I understand that I can withdraw the study at any time.
