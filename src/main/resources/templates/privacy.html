                The Skill Circuits Project is a project from the TU Delft. In this privacy
                statement, it will be explained what personal data the Skill Circuits collects when
                using the website. In this document the term Labrador will also be mentioned.
                Labrador is a project of the TU Delft, which will include the Skill Circuits.

            <p>
                To support your education at the Delft University of Technology , the university has
                a legal ground to store your data. To be more specific, it is a contractual
                necessity: the data processing is necessary for the performance of the contract
                between the student and Delft University of Technology . Because of this, the Skill
                Circuits collects the following data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Email</li>
                <li>Student number</li>
                <li>NetID</li>
                <li>affiliation (if the user is a student or teacher)</li>
                <li>which department/faculty the user is part of</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Furthermore, there exist multiple subgroups in the system. We will describe for each
                subgroup the extra data we store.
            </p>
            <h3 id="student">Student</h3>
            <p>We collect the following information about students:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Courses they are enrolled in</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also collect data about the tasks students complete, so that progress can be
                synchronised across devices and we can refer students back to the last task they
                completed:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which tasks a student has completed and when</li>
                <li>Which tasks a student has selected to do on their path</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="teacher">Teacher</h3>
            <p>For a teacher, we collect the following data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All courses the teacher teaches</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="how-do-we-collect-your-data">How do we collect your data</h2>
            <p>All data we collect is collected when using the Skill Circuits website.</p>

            <h2 id="how-will-we-use-your-data">How will we use your data</h2>
            <p>
                At this moment, we only use the data given to support the functionality the Skill
                Circuits promise, giving students an overview of what tasks they still need to
                complete and where they left of.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data is being used on a need to know basis. Only administrators have access to the
                database.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data from the Skill Circuits is is also used for research purposes. This research is
                done to explore the possibilities of increasing educational quality and investigate
                what type of materials are most effective to teach students about certain concepts.
            </p>
            <p>For this research the following additional data will be stored:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What links were clicked when by whom</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This data will only be accessible to people doing the research and will be
                responsibly handled in such a way that no unauthorised person or persons can get
                access to this data.
            </p>
            <h2 id="how-do-we-store-your-data">How do we store your data</h2>
            <p>
                To comply with GDPR regulations, all data is stored on site at the Delft University

                Access to data is strictly regulated with only select admins having access to the
